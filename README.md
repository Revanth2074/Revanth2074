## 🏎️ The Pursuit of Perfection
*“If you no longer chase the edge of innovation, you’re not a true coder.”*  
I’m **Sai Revanth Singavarapu**, a Computer Science undergrad (B.Tech 2022–2026), racing through the circuits of tech with the precision and passion of Ayrton Senna. Full-stack development, AI-powered systems, and RESTful APIs are my racetracks, and I navigate them with relentless focus. As President of **Aprameya - The Autonomous System Club**, I lead my team like a Formula 1 driver—strategic, fearless, and always pushing the limits. My mission? To code solutions that are as flawless as a pole-position lap and as impactful as a world championship. 🏆
